// 3:20AM March 21, 2016 //

Until not long ago freeCodeCamp.com had their own news portal called "Camper News", where fellow students could submit links to articles and vote on the links. One of the Free Code Camp front-end development projects was to link to the "Camper News API", in order to display the Camper News links in a different style. 

Camper News has been recently replaced by a Free Code Camp sub-reddit, and the front end project I made for it is now consequently broken. It's a shame, since I really don't want to remove it from my portfolio. I'm happy I was able to keep the screenshot I took for the portfolio, but it wont render at all without the JSON file (I should have saved a reference copy). In any case, I guess this is a good opportunity to practice updating an existing code.

I'll be diving into my old code, and exchanging the API provider. 

// nope //

Camper News API is still up, apparently they've deprecated http connections in favor of https. I'm unsure if they are going to remove it completely, so it might be a good idea to make a snapshot of one of their API responses.
